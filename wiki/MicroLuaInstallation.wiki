#summary Basic steps for using MicroLua.

= How to install MicroLua on your linker =

  # Take the [http://code.google.compmicroluadownloads/list latest version] of MicroLua and extract it.
    * Copy the `lua` folder and the correct `.nds` or `.gba` file.
    * Paste them on your linker (the `lua` folder must be at the root of your linker!).
    * You can paste the Lua scripts where you want, but the default directory when you launch _microlua.nds_ is `/lua/script`, so it will be easier to put the scripts in it.
  # Power on your DS:
    * Launch _microLua.nds_.
    * You can browse your linker and launch a Lua script (A button). Have a look at MicroLuaProjects to find one.
