_A tank wargame for two players on one DS (ver. beta5)_

= Details =

This game coded in MicroLua3 allows you to take the commands of a tank in a 2D wargame.<br>
It is always in its beta version : the _one player mode_ isn't playable (the CPU tank is not moving yet) but it can be played in _two players mode_ on one NDS only.<br>
You can find the last version and a description of this open sources game by here :<br>
