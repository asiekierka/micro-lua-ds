= How To Compile MicroLua v3.0. =

== Introduction ==

This page will guide you on how to setup the development environment
for building the source of MicroLua. There are several steps and several
packages to install, but should be relatively straightforward.

== Windows XP ==

First download everything here and then follow the instructions below.

 * Several archives are in the 7z format, so you will need [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-zip] or [http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/peazip_portable PeaZip Portable].
 * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/Automated%20Installer/devkitProUpdater-1.5.0.exe/download devkitPro]
 * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/previous/devkitARM%20release%2024/devkitARM_r24-win32.exe/download devkitARM-r24]
 * PAlib (the version needed is PAlib090801.7z, you can download it in a [http://forum.palib.info/index.php?topic=7048.0 forum thread] with links to many mirrors).
 * [http://brunni.palib.info/new/dl/nds/uLibrary.7z uLibrary]
 * fatlib (The [http://nanolua.fr.nf/nanolua/files/libfat20080530.zip 20080530 version] should have better results, you'll only find it here)
 * The source code ([http://code.google.com/p/microlua/source/checkout Subversion repository] or [http://code.google.com/p/microlua/downloads/list zip])


=== Details ===

==== DevKitPro ====

Start with DevKitPro.  You may use the web installer from the website, or our copy here.
This package is the compiler and binary tools for compiling ARM source code.
Recommend to install to 'c:\devkitpro'. Just don't use spaces in any folder names.

==== DevARM-`r24` ====

Initially MicroLua v3.0 requires to backdate the DevARM library.
This is the ARM 7/9 hardware library.  Rename or delete the DevKitPro `DevArm` folder, then unpack this package into 'c:\devkitpro'.

==== PAlib ====

PAlib is a Nintendo DS hardware library.  This library provides access most of the features of the DS. Install PAlib into 'c:\devkitpro'.

==== uLibrary ====

uLibrary is a lib for low level 'OS' like stuff for ARM processors.
This is built next.  Unpack to 'c:\devkitpro'.

==== fatlib ====

This has to be backdated.  use the version listed above, 20080530.
Extract the zip to a location.  

 * Copy the file '\libfat20080530\nds\lib\libfat.a' to 'devkitPro\libnds\lib'
 * Copy the file '\libfat20080530\nds\include\fat.h' to 'devkitPro\libnds\include'

==== MicroLua Source ====
 # I created a holding folder '\devkitPro\microLuaDs\'
 # Extract the microLua source there
 # Rename the resulting source folder 'Micro Lua DS v3.0\'(the one containing `Examples`, `Fat`...) to 'luads'
 # Copy '\devkitPro\microLuaDs\luads\img\fcsr.dldi' file to '\devkitpro\devkitarm\bin\dldi\' (make the dldi folder)
 # Use `\devkitPro\microLuaDs\luads\Compile All.bat` file to build.

=== Notes ===

==== Environment variables ====
DevKitPro uses 2 environment variables.
They are: 
{{{
 DEVKITPRO=c:\devkitpro
 DEVKITARM=c:\devkitpro\devkitarm
}}}

To do it manually: 
 Start->Control Panel->System<br>
 Then click on 'Advanced' tab<br> 
 Then click the button at the bottom 'Environment Variables'<br> 
 They should be in the bottom list, System Variables<br>


==== Reference Package ====
We should probably make a big package for win32 that contains all this stuff already done. This way newbies can get just one package to unzip and go. Such a package would be about 70Mb zipped.
