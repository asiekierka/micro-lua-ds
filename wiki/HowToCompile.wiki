= How To Compile !MicroLuaDs v3.0. =

== Introduction ==

This page will guide you on how to setup the development environment
for building the source of !MicroLuaDs.  There are several steps and several
packages to install, but should be relatively straightforward.

== Windows XP ==

 * devkitpro
 * devarm-r24
 * PAlib  (may need PeaZip for 7z format)
 * uLibrary
 * fatlib
 * microluads source (svn)

(jmr, we should set this up in svn, either as a pkg set or a project.)


== Details ==

=== !DevKitPro ===
Start with !DevKitPro.  You may use the web installer from the website, or our copy here.
This package is the compiler and binary tools for compiling ARM source code.
Recommend this install goto 'c:\devkitpro'.  Just don't use spaces in any folder names.

=== !DevARM-r24 ===
Initially !MicroLuaDs v3.0 requires to backdate the DevARM library.
This is the ARM 7/9 hardware library.  Rename the !DevKitPro !DevArm folder, then unpack this pkg into 'c:\devkitpro'.

=== PAlib ===
PAlib is a Nintendo DS hardware library.  This library provides access most of the features of the DS.   this package is in a zip form named '7z'.   Winzip does not handle this form, so use !PeaZip Portable.  (jmr, we should repackage this as a help for US users.)  Install PAlib into 'c:\devkitpro'.

=== uLibrary ===
uLibrary is a lib for low level 'OS' like stuff for ARM processors.
This is built next.  Unpack to 'c:\devkitpro'

=== fatlib ===
This may need to be backdated. TBD. jmr

=== !MicroLuaDs Source ===
Get the v3.0 source from subversion.  Copy to c:\devkitpro\microluads\

 * Rename folder to 'luads'
 * copy dldi file to c:\devkitpro\devkitarm\bin\dldi\

Use bat file to build.

== Notes ==
jmr, we should probably make a big package for win32 that contains all this stuff already done.  this way newbies can get just 1 package to unzip and go.  i will see how large all that would be.  same thing for linux.
