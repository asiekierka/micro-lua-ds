= Introduction =

MicroLua is an homebrew for Nintendo DS which allows you to launch [LuaLink Lua] scripts. Plus, tens of functions have been added to Lua 5.1.3 source code, which allows you to easily create applications and games on your favorite console.

= History =

MicroLua was originally created by Risike.

It became open on the 9th of July, 2009. Then the community began to work on this Google Code project around the October of the same year.
