#summary How to use Subversion.

<wiki:toc />

= Introduction =

[http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] is _An open-source revision control system, which aims to be a compelling replacement for CVS_. The main repository of the MicroLua project is hosted here at GoogleCode and is a Subversion one.

= Details =

This page will give you the basic commands to interact with our repository. If you want to use Subversion with a graphical interface, have a look at HowToUseSvnGui.

The recommended way to use the command line interface on a Windows machine is to install [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin]. See HowToUseCygwin for more details.

== Checkout the code ==

See [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svn.c.checkout.html svn checkout] for more details.
{{{
cd /where/I/usually/work/with/microlua
mkdir my_working_copy  # or anything else
cd my_working_copy
svn checkout http://microlua.googlecode.com/svn/ .  # shortcut: svn co ...
# wait a bit for the code to be downloaded
}}}

== Fetch the newest version ==

See [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svn.c.update.html svn update] for more details.
{{{
cd my_working_copy
svn update  # shortcut: svn up ...
# wait a bit for the code to be updated
}}}

If you changed things in your working copy, you may end with conflicts.

== Make changes ==

Edit the code as you usually do, test it.

=== See what changed ===

To see what files were changed, use [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svn.c.status.html svn status]:
{{{
cd my_working_copy
svn status  # shortcut: svn st...
}}}

To see what changed in the files, use [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svn.c.diff.html svn diff]:
{{{
cd my_working_copy
svn diff
}}}

To see what changed in a particular file:
{{{
cd my_working_copy
svn diff path/to/the/file
}}}

=== Write a patch ==

If you don't have commit access, you can publish your changes pasting a patch somewhere or attaching a patch to an issue.

{{{
svn diff (path/to/the/file) > path/where/to/store/the/patch/reason_for_the_changes.diff
}}}
