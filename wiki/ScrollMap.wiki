#summary Description of ScrollMaps

= Introduction =

ScrollMaps are like Maps, but of course there are some differences.

= Characteristics =

First, a ScrollMap can only be displayed on the entire screen, while Maps could be displayed on a part of the screen. But they are faster than simple Maps, and can be scrolled pixel by pixel, and not tile by tile.

= Less functions =

This is a disadvantage: ScrollMaps have less functions than normal Maps. The following ones cannot be used with Scrollmaps:
 * `setTile()`
 * `getTile()`
 * `space()`

In practical terms, it means that you can't modify the structure of the map as you used to, and you cannot set the space between two tiles.

= Changing functions =

 * Because ScrollMaps are displayed on the entire screen, `ScrollMap.draw()` expects only the map to draw (with Maps, it expects coordinates)
 * While `Map.scroll()` expects tiles numbers, `ScrollMap.scroll()` expects pixel values.
 * The others functions (`ScrollMap.new()` and `ScrollMap.destroy()` are unchanged

= Better or worse =

Both types of Maps have advantages and disadvantages, so it's your choice to use simple Maps or ScrollMaps. If you have fixed Maps, which are always the same, use ScrollMaps, it can only be beneficial. But if you have evolving Maps, choose normal Maps.
