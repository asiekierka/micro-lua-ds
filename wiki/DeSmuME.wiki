= Introduction =

Testing MicroLua's homebrews is actually very simple. It can also give results more close to the hardware's than MicroLuaSimulator.

= Steps =

== Emulate on computer ==

  * [http://desmume.org/download/ Download DeSmuME] and install it wherever you want.
  * Start it and open the menu "Emulation\GBA Slot".
  * Be sure you've prepared a folder, representing the root of your SD card, containing a folder "lua" (which a lot of people often forget to copy there). The homebrews go in the folder "scripts".
  * Choose "Compact Flash". Select "folder" and choose the folder you prepared at the previous step.
  * In DeSmuME, start the ROM "luads.nds", which is located wherever you put it.
  * You start using MicroLua and can test your homebrews.

== Emulate on Wii! ==

DeSmuME also exists as a [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/DeSmuME_Wii Wii Homebrews] which allows you to play .nds games on your Wii, thus MicroLua too.

However, the steps are longer to perform:
  * Start the Wii.
  * Launch the Homebrew Channel (a special channel which is not from the Wii Shop).
  * Start DesmumeWII.
  * Start MicroLua.
  * Start a MicroLua game.
