#summary Things to do before, during and after a release.

= Introduction =

Those are all the steps that have to be made for the releases of MicroLua.

= Before the release =

Waiting for the release script... 

  * sources pack
    * update ULUA_VERSION
    * check the README
    * clean it (remove .nds...)
    * if it is a major version, make the .zip archive
  * normal pack
    * compile the .nds, move them to the directory
    * convert the docs from wiki pages to static HTML files using the Python script; copy them to a `Documentation` folder
    * copy the `lua` folder
    * write (or re-use the last one) README and CHANGELOG
      * for minor versions, put the CHANGELOG of the major version with the new one
    * make the .zip archive

= During the release =

  * put the last version in deprecated and remove the "featured" label
  * upload to the GoogleCode download space as "featured" and "archive" both sources and normal packages
  * on the forum:
    * make the release post:
      * try to keep actual presentation
      * give some less conventional description of the new version
      * put the download links
      * copy the CHANGELOG and the instructions to install MicroLua
      * if it is a minor version, keep all of this, just add the new description and change the links.
    * update the front page: download link, version number and image
    * update Reylak's signature
    * update related Wiki pages:
      * HowToCompile (if major version)
      * API
