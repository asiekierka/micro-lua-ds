How to compile Micro Lua DS ?

- Install devkitpro
- You need Devkitarm r24 !!!!!!!!!!!!! Not another one !!!! Download it and replace the latest devkitarm.

- Run Compile.bat (il you have errors, juste run it angain). There are some warnings due to new devkitpro register names... Forget it.

Compile.bat will compile the lualib and Micro Lua DS. You MUST run at least on time. Then if you don't touch to the lualib code but justthe source/main.c, you can only run Compile DS.bat.



Any Question ? Go to the Micro Lua DS official forum : http://microlua.xooit.fr
